```

```{r}

```
Garage area vs sale price shows moderately positive linear relationship. So, as garage area (in sq ft) increases, sales price($) tends to increase.



```{r}

ggplot(ames_n,

# Response Variable

`Sale_Price` is the response variable in `Ames` dataset. It is not normally distributed. We are transforming it using filtering the outliers. We consider all sale price values greater than 339500 as outliers.

```{r}

## Model Assessment

Assessing our models to get the best one. 
```{r}
library(modelsummary)

models <- list(model1_fit,model2_fit,model3_fit)

modelsummary(models)
```

## Model Diagnostics

We chose the best model as pair of Sale_Price and Total_Area has the higher R2 value. Higher R2 is a measure of getting the best fitting model. R2 value is used to predict the dependency value of a model on which we can rely..





### co-relation between sale price and ground floor living area

```{r}
  
# summarise(cor(as.numeric(tt_n$Sale_Price) ,tt_n$Lot_Area))

```
```{r}
tidy(model2_fit)
```



```{r}
glance(model2_fit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(tt_n) +
  aes(x = Total_Area, y = Sale_Price) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1L, colour = "#112446") +
  labs(
    x = "Total Area",
    y = "Sale Price",
    title = "Distribution of total area with Sale price"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = 'y~x')
  

```
To assess whether the linear model is reliable or not, Three checkings are required. (1) linearity, (2) nearly normal residuals, and (3) constant variability.

```{r}
model_aug <- augment(model2_fit)

model_aug
```

### Linearity:

In above graph we already checked if the co-relation between sale price and Total area is linear using a scatter plot. Now,We should also verify this condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values.

```{r}
ggplot(data = model_aug, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  xlab("Fitted values") +
  ylab("Residuals")
```
### Nearly normal residuals: 

To check this condition is met or not, Lets look at a histogram of the residuals.
```{r}
ggplot(data = model_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(colour="red")) +
  xlab("Residuals")
```






## Data Transformation and Re-fitting the Best Model

The best selected model is Sale Price and Ground Living Area. 

```{r}



ggplot(tt_n) +
  aes(x = Total_Area, y = Sale_Price) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE,method = "gam", formula = y ~ x)+
  labs(
    x = "Total Area",
    y = "Sale Price",
    title = "Distribution of total area with Sale price"
  )

```

## Interpret the slope: 

If the Total Housing area is increased by 1000 square feet, we predict the           Sale price of the house will increase by approximately $1,24,980. 

## Interpret the intercept:

If the Total Housing area is increased by 0 square feet, we predict the 
Sale price of the house will increase by approximately $13,290.


## Interpret the strength:

The strength of the model is represented by the R-squared which is 50%
